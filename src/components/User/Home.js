                  Kim Rutherford is a lifelong animal lover, whose caring and
                  kindness to all creatures is well known in the community. She
                  was able to turn her passion for animals into a business that
                  she truly loves. Kimâ€™s farm is an eclectic mix of furry and
                  feathered friends, and she is always rescuing something new to
                  add to the farm family. Kim and her staff are committed to
                  providing a loving home away from home for your pet!

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p className="text-justify tan">
                  Kim wanted to help animals by finding them their forever
                  homes. She started her rescue in 2011. Every rescue animal becomes
                  her child, just like her pet care kids. No matter the
                  situation, Kim wants to save every soul possible. She wanted
                  to save as many animals from kill shelters and puppy mills as she could.
                  If she could she would take in every single dog, who
                  needs help. The dogs that are lucky enough to be saved by Kim,
                  stay with her until they are ready to find a forever home.
                  When the match between dog and family are perfect, Kim makes
                  sure the rescue is going to his loving, caring, and forever
                  home!
